            <h1>WHAT IS NBA ACADEMY?</h1>
            <br>
            <br>

            NBA Academy is a year-round elite basketball development initiative that provides top high school-age
            prospects from outside the U.S. with a holistic approach to player development and a predictable pathway to
            maximize their potential. The NBA Academy program includes academies across Australia, India, Mexico and
            Senegal for top prospects from their respective countries and continents.

            The NBA identifies prospective athletes through a global network of scouts, relationships with local
            federations around the world, the mobile basketball training application HomeCourt, and the league’s other
            international basketball development programs: Jr. NBA, NBA Basketball School and Basketball Without
            Borders. Prospective NBA Academy athletes are evaluated based on skill level, character and long-term
            potential.

            The program focuses on health and wellness, character development and life skills, and gives prospects the
            opportunity to learn the game from coaches who the NBA hires with professional, collegiate and international
            coaching experience.

            Depending on the location of the academy, participants can receive academic support, including attending a
            local public school, receiving a scholarship to a local private school, or using an NCAA-approved virtual
            learning program.

            As part of the program, the prospects compete against top competition throughout the year and have an
            opportunity to be selected for travel teams that play in international tournaments and exhibition games.
